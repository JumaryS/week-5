# What I learned in week 5



## Booleans: True or False

         1. &&: and

         2. ||: or

         3. <:The less than operator returns if the left operand is less than the right operand

         4. >: The greater than operator returns if the left operand is greater than the right operand

         5. <=:The less than or equal operator returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand

        6. >=: The greater than or equal operator returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand

### If: The if statement is used to check a condition and if the condition is true, we run a block of statements (called the if-block), else we process another block of statements (called the else-block). The else clause is optional.

### If else :The if/else statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is true. If the condition is false, another block of code can be executed. The if/else statement is a part of JavaScript's "Conditional" Statements, which are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

### Functions: A function is a JavaScript procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.


### 1. Console.log :

    2. Process.argv: files in your terminal

    3. Split :The split() method is used to split a string into an array of substrings, and returns the new array. Tip: If an empty string ("") is used as the separator, the string is split between each character.

          1. Reverse :The reverse() method reverses the order of the elements in an array. Note: this method will change the original array.

          2. Join : The join() method creates and returns a new string by concatenating all of the elements in an array (or an array-like object), separated by commas or a specified separator string. If the array has only one item, then that item will be returned without using the separator.
